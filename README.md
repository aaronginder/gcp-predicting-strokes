# Predicting Strokes Using Vertex AI on GCP

![github-header](static/github_header.jpeg)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual has had a stroke given a series of attributes. Attributes such as age, gender, BMI, marriage status will be used as regressors. This repository contains code for model building, validation and deployment to the serverless Vertex AI product in Google Cloud Platform.
## Data
The data used in this model was obtained by fedesoriano and made available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). Descriptive metrics about the data can be views in the `./src/data_analysis/reports/descriptive_statistics.html` report. The data quality is rated as gold on Kaggle which signals high-quality and richness of data. Therefore, there is not much data cleansing required.
